# AI & Machine Learning 

This project explores two major areas of machine learning: image classification and reinforcement learning.
- **Task 1** applies supervised learning to classify images using different algorithms.
- **Task 2** explores reinforcement learning through Grid World, implementing Value Iteration and Q-Learning.

Each section includes Jupyter notebooks and data files needed to reproduce the analysis.

## Task 1: Classification

**Notebook:** machine_learning_cw.ipynb  
**Data:** imageset/  
**Outcome:** Model with data augmentation performed better with 76% accuracy compared to 70% accuracy without data augmentation.

## Task 2: Reinforcement Learning (Grid World)

**Notebook:** t2_machine_learning.ipynb  
**Concepts Covered:** 
- State action value updates
- Reward maximisation
- Exploration vs exploitation
